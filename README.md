### **Stochastic.js**

This package is created to bring closer the stochastic calculus in Typescript.

### **Installation**

```
yarn add stochastic-js
```

```
npm i stochastic-js

### **Maintenance**

This is a totally new project. The modules will be come in the future as I have time for it or if there is any request.

### **Available modules**

- normal distribution based on Box-MÃ¼ller transformation
- ordinary Wiener process
- geometric brownian motion

### **Future plans**

- [ ] Add multiple normal distribution generator
- [ ] Add different stochastic process, SDEs
- [ ] Add fractional process support
