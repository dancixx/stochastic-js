### **Stochastic.js**

This package is created to bring closer the stochastic calculus in Typescript.

### **Installation**

```
yarn add stochastic-js
```

```
npm i stochastic-js
```

### **Maintenance**

This is a totally new project. The modules will be come in the future as I have time for it or if there is any request.

### **Available modules**

**Continuous-time processes**

- Wiener (Brownian motion)
- Correlated Wieners (constant correlation, stochastic correlation based on tanh(OU))
- Brownian bridge

**Diffusion processes**

- Geometric Brownian motion (GBM)
- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU, Vasicek)
- Cox-Ingelsoll-Ross (CIR)

**Volatility models**

- Heston (constant correlation and stochastic correlation)

### **Future plans**

- [ ] Add multiple normal distribution generator
- [ ] Add different stochastic process, SDEs
- [ ] Add fractional process support
